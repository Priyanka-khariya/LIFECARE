            ➤ Ortho diseases, such as arthritis and bursitis, affect the musculoskeletal system - most commonly the bones or joints. They can cause pain and dysfunction, making even normal daily activities difficult/<br>

            ➤ Cause of this may be joint injury or overuse such as knee bending and repetitive stress can damage a joint. This may also be inherited genetically.<br>
            
            ➤ A fault in the immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues in the joints.<br>
            
            ➤ Some common orthopedic issues are-lower back pain, knee pain, hamstring   pain, plantar fasciitis, hip fracture, arthritis.<br>

        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 7px;">
            ➤Pain: affected joints might hurt during or after movement.<br>

            ➤Grating sensation: you might feel a grating sensation when you use the joint, and you might hear popping or crackling.<br>
